## 📌 The Problem

Waterproofing failures are among the **most common and costly post-handover defect claims** in residential construction. The root cause is almost always the same:

> Stages were skipped. Approvals were verbal. Photos were never taken. There is no paper trail when accountability is needed.

**QualityTrack WP makes stage-skipping impossible, approvals unambiguous, and the audit trail automatic.**

## 🎯 What This Demo Shows

This is a fully interactive, zero-dependency browser-based demo that simulates the complete lifecycle of a waterproofing quality control activity across multiple projects, towers, and roles. No backend, no login, no installation just open and explore.

Select your role on the cover page and the system adapts entirely to what you need to see:

<table>
<tr>
<td width="25%" align="center"><b>🏗️<br>Civil RCC Engineer</b></td>
<td>Creates the activity with 9-field cascading master data form (Project → Tower → Floor → Flat). Fills Stage 1 RCC Structural Readiness checklist with location-wise responses and mandatory photo evidence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><b>🧑‍🔧<br>Civil Finish Team</b></td>
<td>Reviews Stage 1 submissions with independent YES/NO site inspection. Fills Stages 3, 4 & 5 checklists — Surface Preparation, Waterproofing Coating, and Protection Screed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><b>🔧<br>MEP Team</b></td>
<td>Fills Stage 2 — MEP Core Cut & Installation checklist. 6 items covering core cutting, pipe routing, water testing, and conduit installation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><b>🔍<br>QC Inspector</b></td>
<td>Reviews all 5 stages with location-wise inspection. Issues approvals or rejections with mandatory comments. Raises Non-Conformance Reports (NCRs) with full freeze and escalation workflow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><b>👑<br>Project Quality Head</b></td>
<td>Approves or rejects NCR submissions from QC Engineer. NCR approval triggers immediate activity freeze and 10-minute escalation timer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><b>📊<br>Project / Tower Manager</b></td>
<td>Executive Dashboard with real-time KPIs like quality score donut chart, monthly trend bar charts, project health cards, NCR risk watch, activity pipeline table, and timeline.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><b>🏢<br>Senior Management</b></td>
<td>Read-only portfolio visibility across all projects, towers, and activities. Same Executive Dashboard for leadership review and stakeholder reporting.</td>

## 🔥 NCR & Freeze System

The platform includes a full **Non-Conformance Report (NCR)** lifecycle:

```
QC raises NCR → Quality Head reviews → Approve: Activity FROZEN + 10-min timer
                                     → Reject: Work continues

    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │         NCR Approved — FROZEN           │
    │  All stage progression halted           │
    │  10-minute escalation timer starts      │
    │  Responsible party must submit          │
    │  compliance with corrective actions     │
    └────────────────────┬────────────────────┘
                         ▼
              QC reviews compliance
              ├─ Accept → Activity UNFROZEN
              └─ Reject → Escalation triggered
```

> NCR events automatically propagate to the Executive Dashboard — frozen status, NCR count, and timeline all update in real-time.

| 🔄 **Live Dashboard Sync** | All stage approvals, NCR events, and status changes automatically propagate to the Executive Dashboard via `syncPortfolio()`. |
| 📱 **Fully Responsive** | Flawless mobile experience with fixed slide-in sidebar, horizontal scrollable tabs, and fluid 100vw constraints. Works on any device without horizontal overflow. |
| 🎨 **Enterprise Aesthetics**| Premium MAANG-level UI featuring glassmorphism (frosted glass), deep radial dark-mode gradients, smooth cubic-bezier animations, and BI-style interactive glowing KPI cards. |
| 🖨️ **Print / PDF Ready** | Consolidated Activity Record generates a strictly formatted, legally admissible "Confidential Internal Quality Assurance Record" PDF with formal headers. |
| 📋 **Consolidated Record** | Auto-generated on activity closure — all locations, all stages, all QC decisions, DRG references, and photo evidence archived. |
| 🏢 **Multi-Project Portfolio** | 3 projects (Skyline Residency Phase II, Metro Heights Phase I, Greenview Apartments) with 12 demo activities across multiple towers. |
